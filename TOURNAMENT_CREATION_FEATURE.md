## 🗄️ Database Structure

### tournaments Table

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| name | TEXT | Tournament name |
| description | TEXT | Tournament description |
| admin_id | UUID | Creator (from auth.users) |
| format | TEXT | Always 'round_robin_gf' for now |
| team_size | INTEGER | Always 3 for now |
| status | TEXT | draft, registration_open, etc. |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Auto-updated |

### tournament_settings Table

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| tournament_id | UUID | Links to tournament |
| round_robin_format | TEXT | 'ap3' (All Played 3) |
| semifinal_format | TEXT | 'bo3' (Best of 3) |
| grandfinal_format | TEXT | 'bo5' (Best of 5) |
| custom_settings | JSONB | For future configs |

**Auto-created** when tournament is created!

**Note:** AP3 (All Played 3) means 3 games are always played, and winner is determined by best score (e.g., 2-1 or 3-0). This is different from Bo3 where play stops when a team gets 2 wins.

## ✨ What's Hardcoded (By Design)

For Phase 1, these are intentionally fixed:

- **Tournament Format**: Round Robin with Grand Final
- **Team Size**: 3v3
- **Match Formats**: 
  - Round Robin: AP3 (All Played 3 - always 3 games, best score wins)
  - Semifinals: Bo3
  - Grand Final: Bo5

**Why?** Keeps the UI simple while the database is ready for future flexibility!

## 💡 Code Highlights

### Automatic Settings Creation

When you create a tournament, settings are auto-created via database trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_tournament_created
  AFTER INSERT ON public.tournaments
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_tournament();
```

### Clean Service Layer

All database operations abstracted:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await createTournament({
  name: 'My Tournament',
  description: 'An awesome tournament'
});
```

### Protected Routes

```javascript
<Route path="/dashboard" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <Dashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```
