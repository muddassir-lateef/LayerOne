# Player Categorization Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A complete player categorization system that allows tournament admins to assign skill tiers to registered players.

## Files Created

### Database
- **`database/player_categories_schema.sql`**
  - `player_categories` table with RLS policies
  - Helper functions: `get_uncategorized_players()`, `get_categorized_players()`
  - Unique constraint: one category per player per tournament
  - Cascade delete on tournament/user removal

### Frontend Services
- **`client/src/services/playerCategoryService.js`**
  - `assignPlayerCategory()` - Assign/update player tier

  - `getCategoryStats()` - Get tier distribution statistics

### UI Components

### Documentation

  - Complete setup guide
  - Feature documentation
  - API reference
  - Troubleshooting guide

## Features

### Skill Tiers
- **S-Tier** (Red) - Elite players
- **A-Tier** (Orange) - Advanced players
- **B-Tier** (Blue) - Intermediate players
- **Misc** (Gray) - Other players

### Admin Capabilities
✅ View all registered players
✅ See uncategorized players first
✅ Quick-assign to any tier
✅ Move players between tiers
✅ Remove tier assignments
✅ View categorization statistics
✅ See player preferences on hover (via PlayerCard)

### Statistics Dashboard
- Total categorized players
- Count per tier (S/A/B/Misc)
- Uncategorized count
- Visual tier indicators

### Player Information Display
Uses the existing `PlayerCard` component to show:
- Discord avatar and username
- AoE2Insights profile link (clickable)
- Preferred position (Flank/Pocket)
- Preferred civs for flank position (2)
- Preferred civs for pocket position (2)
- Preferred maps (3)
- Additional notes

## User Flow

1. **Admin navigates to tournament detail page**
2. **Clicks "Categorize Players" button** (green button, appears when registration is open or closed)
3. **Reviews uncategorized players**
   - Hovers to see detailed preferences
   - Checks AoE2Insights profiles if needed
4. **Assigns tiers using quick-assign buttons**
   - Player moves to appropriate tier section
   - Statistics update automatically
5. **Adjusts categorizations as needed**
   - Remove button (✕) to uncategorize
   - Reassign to different tier
6. **Monitors progress via statistics**
   - Ensure all players are categorized
7. **Proceeds to next step** (Captain Selection)

## Database Schema

```sql
player_categories (
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY
  tournament_id: UUID REFERENCES tournaments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  user_id: UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  category: TEXT CHECK (category IN ('S-Tier', 'A-Tier', 'B-Tier', 'Misc'))
  assigned_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  assigned_by: UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
  
  UNIQUE(tournament_id, user_id)
)

-- Indexes for performance
idx_player_categories_tournament
idx_player_categories_user
idx_player_categories_category
```

## Security (RLS)

**View**: Anyone can see player categories
**Modify**: Only tournament admin can assign/update/delete

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Run the database schema**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute database/player_categories_schema.sql in Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. **Navigate to a tournament with registrations**:
   - Go to tournament detail page
   - Click "Categorize Players" button

3. **Test categorization**:
   - Assign players to different tiers
   - Move players between tiers
   - Remove categorizations
   - Verify statistics update

4. **Test permissions**:
   - Try accessing with non-admin account
   - Should show permission error

## What's Next

After player categorization is complete, the next features to implement are:

1. **Captain Selection** - Admin selects captains from categorized players
2. **Snake Draft** - Captains draft players by tier (S→A→B→Misc)
3. **Team Formation** - Create teams from draft results

## Technical Highlights

- **Performance**: Indexed queries for fast player lookup
- **Data Integrity**: Unique constraints prevent duplicates
- **Security**: RLS policies enforce admin-only modifications
- **UX**: Color-coded tiers, hover cards, instant updates
- **Reusability**: PlayerCard component reused from registration feature
- **Scalability**: Database functions handle complex queries efficiently
